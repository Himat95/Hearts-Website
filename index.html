	<h3>How to Play Hearts</h3>
	
	<h4>Cards</h4> 
	<p>There are 52 cards used within this game (jokers are not included). This splits
		deck into 13 cards for each suit (Spades, Clubs, Diamonds and Hears). The suit Heart
		has a special effect.
	</p>
	
	<h4>How the game works</h4> 
	<p>The game is played in tricks; a trick is made of 4 players each putting down a card, 
	this makes a total of 4 cards set in the middle of the table. The trick played is then given to the winner. 
	The winner will add points to his score dependant on how many Hearts suit cards he has acquired and if  
	they have acquired the Queen of Spades through the trick. If neither of the card types are won through the trick, 
	the player's score stays the same.
	</p>
	
	<ul> 
	<li>Heart Card - 1 point</li>
	<li>Queen of Spades - 13 points</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Shooting over the moon</h4>
	<p>This is a special condition within the game that is triggered by a player obtaining all the Heart cards (13 in total) 
	and the queen of spades through winning tricks. Instead of scoring 26, the player who has shot over the moon will score 
	0 and all the opponents have 26 points added to their score. 
	</p>
	
	<h4>Gameplay</h4> 
	
	<ol class="gameplay_list">
	<li>Each player picks 3 cards and passes to the side (clockwise)</li>
	<li>The player holding the 2 of clubs will start, if 2 has been removed: 3 of clubs will start</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p class="rules">All players must follow the suit in each trick, if they do not have the suit cards, they can use 
	different suit cards. However, for the first trick, if a player does not have a club card, they 
	cannot play a heart or the queen of spades.
	</p>
	
	<ol class="gameplay_list_2">
	<li>Each player throws a card</li>
	<li>A trick is full when it receives 1 card from each player</li>
	<li>The player who threw the highest card in the trick wins</li>
	</ol> 
	
	<p class="rules"> You can only win the trick if the thrown card's suit is the same as the one that started
	the trick. Therefore the starting card is very important for strategy!
	</p>
	
	<ol class="gameplay_list_3">
	<li>The winner starts the next trick</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Hearts may not be used until a heart or the queen of spades has been discarded through a player unable to 
	play the required suit (Clubs, Diamonds and Spades).
	</p>
	
	<ol class="gameplay_list_4">
	<li>Repeat the process until you run out of cards</li>
	<li>Winner is decided dependant on who has the lowest points</li> 
	</ol>
