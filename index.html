			<h3 class="title">How to Play Hearts</h3>
	
				<h4 class="how2-title">Cards</h4> 
					<p>There are 52 cards used within this game (jokers are not included). This splits
						deck into 13 cards for each suit (Spades, Clubs, Diamonds and Hears). The suit Heart
						has a special effect.
					</p>
	

				<h4 class="how2-title">How the game works</h4> 
					<p>The game is played in tricks; a trick is made of 4 players each putting down a card, 
						this makes a total of 4 cards set in the middle of the table. The trick played is then given to the winner. 
						The winner will add points to his score dependant on how many Hearts suit cards he has acquired and if  
						they have acquired the Queen of Spades through the trick. If neither of the card types are won through the trick, 
						the player's score stays the same.
					</p>
	

					<ul> 
						<li>Heart Card - 1 point</li>
						<li>Queen of Spades - 13 points</li>
					</ul>
	


				<h4 class="how2-title">Shooting over the moon</h4>
					<p>This is a special condition within the game that is triggered by a player obtaining all the Heart cards (13 in total) 
						and the queen of spades through winning tricks. Instead of scoring 26, the player who has shot over the moon will score 
						0 and all the opponents have 26 points added to their score. 
					</p>
	



				<h4 class="how2-title">Gameplay</h4> 
	
					<ol class="step-list">
						<li>Each player picks 3 cards and passes to the side (clockwise)</li>
						<li>The player holding the 2 of clubs will start, if 2 has been removed: 3 of clubs will start</li>
					</ol>
	

					<p class="rules">All players must follow the suit in each trick, if they do not have the suit cards, they can use 
					different suit cards. However, for the first trick, if a player does not have a club card, they 
					cannot play a heart or the queen of spades.
					</p>
	

					<ol class="step-list2">
						<li>Each player throws a card</li>
						<li>A trick is full when it receives 1 card from each player</li>
						<li>The player who threw the highest card in the trick wins</li>
					</ol> 
	

					<p class="rules"> You can only win the trick if the thrown card's suit is the same as the one that started
					the trick. Therefore the starting card is very important for strategy!
					</p>
	

					<ol class="step-list3">
						<li>The winner starts the next trick</li>
					</ol>
	

					<p>Hearts may not be used until a heart or the queen of spades has been discarded through a player unable to 
					play the required suit (Clubs, Diamonds and Spades).
					</p>
	

					<ol class="step-list4">
						<li>Repeat the process until you run out of cards</li>
						<li>Winner is decided dependant on who has the lowest points</li> 
					</ol>

				<p class="about-text">When selecting my final year project, i wanted to avoid the norm. 
				The norm being students creating websites with a SQL database linked through PHP (70% of
				the students in final year did this!). Therefore i wanted to something more challenging and 
				fun. So i made a website that has a SQL databased linked with PHP... Just kidding! 
				</p>


				<p class="about-text">The game itself is created using Java SE 8. 
				It employs a powerful greedy heuristic algorithm that is capable of providing a challenging 
				game for casual players. Furthermore the game is concurrent (thread based), why you ask? because
				my supervisor said so. 
				</p>


				<p class="about-text">This website wasn't only made to download the game. Further work will be done
				on making the game multiplayer. Ending note, what does a haskell compiler and my brain have in common... 
				<span id="joke">We are both lazy.</span>
