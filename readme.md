Hearts - This website will be the host for my card game that will be finished (in GUI version on week 27)


Information Architecture
	A lot of planning has gone into this (even though it might not look like it), The reason why the site
	has very few topics is due to the theory of users only being able to handle 7 pieces of information at
	a time. Having this limitation, the site's is simple by design (having only 4 navigation links).
	Furthermore The an entire section is given to the game so the user lose his/her focus, this guarantees
	the maximum focus on the gaming experience. The information is also hidden through the use of tabs (How2,
	about and feedback). The design thought for this also complements the human focus and memory limitation,
	for the user can simply navigate through the simple radio button interface for information when needed, but
	otherwise, the information isn't cluttered around the place to distract and annoy. 
	
	
Proximity 
	As mentioned within the IA section, the information given is highly organised and separated to allow very
	clutter and wasteful information to the user, for the website is not designed to distract from the gaming
	experience... even though its a card game. High visual guidance is offered within the site, firstly there is
	clear separation and visibility of what the user wants to navigate to, furthermore the critical to unnecessary 
	information is visually guided by colour density. For the most critical part (game) is a spiking red colour, compared
	to the less necessary information (about and feedback) that are lightly coloured. Each section of the site has
	a different colour background, this background is same as the options given in the main navigation menu, it hints
	to the user what section they are in without reading as the colour from the menu selection is the same as the relevant
	topics, and this is done for each section. The second navigation menu (tab radio buttons) are coloured purple to stop
	the user and make them understand, "this is the aside section", travel no further if you are playing the game. The visual
	hint is more than enough to make others notice that its separate from the game. 
	
	
Alignment
	Alignment is strongly used for the main menu, every navigation section is evenly divided and smartly arranged (high to low priority of interest). 
	Moreover, the game itself is evenly aligned into the middle of the site and the navigation tabs under the game section are evenly arranged. The
	text is also aligned with the headings. 

Repetition
	The colour scheme used is meaningfully selected and used appropriately for each section. Through-out tab interface,
	all paragraphs share same or similar styles, there is no text that is completely different. Therefore the site has
	a consistent house style (promotes professionalism).
	
Contrast
	The case is clear enough from the previous paragraphs that the site is built on colours, each one symbolising importance
	of information and the colours are used through-out to make the user understand which section they are in (red is for game
	and it is only for game, no other sections). The colours go beyond of simply being eye-pleasing, they are used due to the 
	name of the game (Hearts). The word heart places the image of love or an actual red beating heart within the brain, and 
	this is used to the site's advantage (by building a colour scheme around this concept). 
	

	
Accessibility
	This is naturally included within the code through the use of html5 tags.
	
	
Extra Information
	The Smooth scrolling isn't fully functional, the according tab must be selected at the bottom of the page
	before using the main nav. There javascript i produced was insufficent for this task and therefore i have
	limited functionality.
